# Enhanced Zeus Modules
**Enhanced Zeus Modules (EZM)** was originally created by [GamesByChris](https://github.com/Chrisdw1002) and [M9-SD](https://github.com/M9-SD) as a private script for Public Zeus. After scripted compositions were added Expung3d took the base functionality from EZM and made it into a public composition. Since the public release of EZM, the script has grown substantially and is now the go-to solution for vanilla Zeus improvements.

## What It Does
EZM adds a ton of new modules to Zeuses at the click of a button. Simply placing the composition as Zeus will add all of the modules to Zeus without the need for mods. In addition, everything is client side, no need to worry about lagging the server.

All the scripts in EZM are specifically built for <strong>Arma 3 Public Zeus servers</strong>, with everything within the script complying with the BattlEye filters applied to the Official Servers.

Not only does EZM add modules, but it also can add new vanilla factions to the Zeus interface. Such as: the Malden Defense Force, FIA+, AAF+, CSAT+, and Better Civilians. You can check out the EZM factions by clicking the banner below:
